HttpReceiveFailure,An error occurred while receiving the HTTP response to {0}. This could be due to the service endpoint binding not using the HTTP protocol. This could also be due to an HTTP request context being aborted by the server (possibly due to the service shutting down). See server logs for more details.
HttpRegistrationAccessDenied,HTTP could not register URL {0}. Your process does not have access rights to this namespace (see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70353 for details).
HttpRegistrationAlreadyExists,HTTP could not register URL {0}. Another application has already registered this URL with HTTP.SYS.
HttpRegistrationLimitExceeded,HTTP could not register URL {0} because the MaxEndpoints quota has been exceeded. To correct this, either close other HTTP-based services, or increase your MaxEndpoints registry key setting (see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70352 for details).
HttpRegistrationPortInUse,HTTP could not register URL {0} because TCP port {1} is being used by another application.
HttpRequestAborted,The HTTP request to '{0}' was aborted.  This may be due to the local channel being closed while the request was still in progress.  If this behavior is not desired, then update your code so that it does not close the channel while request operations are still in progress.
HttpRequestTimedOut,The HTTP request to '{0}' has exceeded the allotted timeout of {1}. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.
HttpRequiresSingleAuthScheme,The '{0}' authentication scheme has been specified on the HTTP factory. However, the factory only supports specification of exactly one authentication scheme. Valid authentication schemes are Digest, Negotiate, NTLM, Basic, or Anonymous.
HttpResponseAborted,The HTTP request context was aborted while writing the response.  As a result, the response may not have been completely written to the network.  This can be remedied by gracefully closing the request context rather than aborting it.
HttpResponseTimedOut,The HTTP request to '{0}' has exceeded the allotted timeout of {1} while reading the response. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a longer timeout.
HttpSendFailure,An error occurred while making the HTTP request to {0}. This could be due to the fact that the server certificate is not configured properly with HTTP.SYS in the HTTPS case. This could also be caused by a mismatch of the security binding between the client and the server.
HttpServerTooBusy,The HTTP service located at {0} is unavailable.  This could be because the service is too busy or because no endpoint was found listening at the specified address. Please ensure that the address is correct and try accessing the service again later.
HttpsExplicitIdentity,The HTTPS channel factory does not support explicit specification of an identity in the EndpointAddress unless the authentication scheme is NTLM or Negotiate.
HttpsIdentityMultipleCerts,The endpoint identity specified when creating the HTTPS channel to '{0}' contains multiple server certificates.  However, the HTTPS transport only supports the specification of a single server certificate.

HttpSpnNotFound,The SPN for the responding server at URI '{0}' could not be determined.
HttpsServerCertThumbprintMismatch,The server certificate with name '{0}' failed identity verification because its thumbprint ('{1}') does not match the one specified in the endpoint identity ('{2}').  As a result, the current HTTPS request has failed.  Please update the endpoint identity used on the client or the certificate used by the server.
HttpTargetNameDictionaryConflict,The entry found in AuthenticationManager's CustomTargetNameDictionary for {0} does not match the requested identity of {1}.
HttpToMustEqualVia,The binding specified requires that the to and via URIs must match because the Addressing Version is set to None. The to URI specified was '{0}'. The via URI specified was '{1}'.
HttpTransferError,An error ({0}) occurred while transmitting data over the HTTP channel.
HttpTransportCannotHaveMultipleAuthenticationSchemes,The policy being imported for contract '{0}:{1}' contains multiple HTTP authentication scheme assertions.  Since at most one such assertion is allowed, policy import has failed.  This may be resolved by updating the policy to contain no more than one HTTP authentication scheme assertion.

SFxCollectionWrongType2,The collection of type {0} does not support values of type {1}.
SFxConfigChannelConfigurationNotFound,Could not find endpoint element with name '{0}' and contract '{1}' in the ServiceModel client configuration section. This might be because no configuration file was found for your application, or because no endpoint element matching this name could be found in the client element.
SFxConfigContractNotFound,Could not find default endpoint element that references contract '{0}' in the ServiceModel client configuration section. This might be because no configuration file was found for your application, or because no endpoint element matching this contract could be found in the client element.
SFxConfigLoaderMultipleEndpointMatchesSpecified2,The endpoint configuration section for contract '{0}' with name '{1}' could not be loaded because more than one endpoint configuration with the same name and contract were found. Please check your config and try again.

SFxNameCannotBeEmpty,The Name property must be a non-empty string.
SFxNeedProxyBehaviorOperationSelector2,Cannot handle invocation of {0} on interface {1} because the OperationSelector on ClientRuntime is null.
SFxNoBatchingForReleaseOnComplete,TransactedBatchingBehavior validation failed. Service cannot be started. Transacted batching requires ServiceBehavior.ReleaseServiceInstanceOnTransactionComplete to be false.
SFxNoBatchingForSession,TransactedBatchingBehavior validation failed. Service or client cannot be started. Transacted batching is not supported for session contracts. Remove transacted batching behavior from the endpoint or define a non-sessionful contract.
SFxNoDefaultConstructor,The service type provided could not be loaded as a service because it does not have a default (parameter-less) constructor. To fix the problem, add a default constructor to the type, or pass an instance of the type to the host.
SFxNoEndpointMatchingAddress,The message with To '{0}' cannot be processed at the receiver, due to an AddressFilter mismatch at the EndpointDispatcher.  Check that the sender and receiver's EndpointAddresses agree.
SFxNoEndpointMatchingAddressForConnectionOpeningMessage,The message with Action '{0}' cannot be processed at the receiver because this Action is reserved for the connection opening messages only and cannot be sent from client to server. To invoke this operation on the server, call the '{1}' method on the client proxy instead.
SFxNoEndpointMatchingContract,The message with Action '{0}' cannot be processed at the receiver, due to a ContractFilter mismatch at the EndpointDispatcher. This may be because of either a contract mismatch (mismatched Actions between sender and receiver) or a binding/security mismatch between the sender and the receiver.  Check that sender and receiver have the same contract and the same binding (including security requirements, e.g. Message, Transport, None).
SFxNoMostDerivedContract,The contract specified by type '{0}' is ambiguous.  The type derives from at least two different types that each define its own service contract.  For this type to be used as a contract type, exactly one of its inherited contracts must be more derived than any of the others.
SFxNonConcurrentOrEnsureOrderedDispatch,The '{0}' service is configured with EnsureOrderedDispatch set to true, but the ConcurrencyMode is not set to Single. EnsureOrderedDispatch requires the use of ConcurrencyMode.Single.
SFxNone2004,The WS-Addressing \
SFxNonExceptionThrown,An object that is not an exception was thrown.
SFxNonInitiatingOperation1,The operation '{0}' cannot be the first operation to be called because IsInitiating is false.

SFxNullReplyFromExtension2,Extension {0} prevented call to operation '{1}' from replying by setting the reply to null.
SFxNullReplyFromFormatter2,Formatter {0} returned a null reply message for call to operation '{1}'.
SFxOneWayAndTransactionsIncompatible,The one-way operation '{1}' on ServiceContract '{0}' is configured for transaction flow. Transactions cannot be flowed over one-way operations.
SFxOneWayMessageToTwoWayMethod0,The incoming message with action could not be processed because it is targeted at a request-reply operation, but cannot be replied to as the MessageId property is not set.
SFxOperationBehaviorAttributeOnlyOnServiceClass,OperationBehaviorAttribute can only go on the service class, it cannot be put on the ServiceContract interface. Method '{0}' on type '{1}' violates this.
SFxOperationBehaviorAttributeReleaseInstanceModeDoesNotApplyToCallback,The ReleaseInstanceMode property on OperationBehaviorAttribute can only be set on non-callback operations. Method '{0}' violates this.
SFxOperationContractOnNonServiceContract,Method '{0}' has OperationContractAttribute, but enclosing type '{1}' does not have ServiceContractAttribute. OperationContractAttribute can only be used on methods in ServiceContractAttribute types or on their CallbackContract types.
SFxOperationContractProviderOnNonServiceContract,Method '{1}' has {0}, but enclosing type '{2}' does not have ServiceContractAttribute. {0} can only be used on methods in ServiceContractAttribute types.
SFxOperationDescriptionNameCannotBeEmpty,OperationDescription's Name must be a non-empty string.
SFxOperationMustHaveOneOrTwoMessages,OperationDescription '{0}' is invalid because its Messages property contains an invalid number of MessageDescription instances. Each OperationDescription must have one or two messages.
SFxParameterCountMismatch,There was a mismatch between the number of supplied arguments and the number of expected arguments.  Specifically, the argument '{0}' has '{1}' elements while the argument '{2}' has '{3}' elements.
SFxParameterMustBeArrayOfOneElement,The 'parameters' argument must be an array of one element.
SFxParameterMustBeMessage,The 'parameters' argument must be an array that contains a single Message object.

SFxParametersMustBeEmpty,The 'parameters' argument must be either null or an empty array.
SFxPartNameMustBeUniqueInRpc,Message part name {0} is not unique in an RPC Message.
SFxProxyRuntimeMessageCannotBeNull,In operation '{0}', cannot pass null to methods that take Message as input parameter.
SFxReceiveContextPropertyMissing,Required message property '{0}' is missing from the IncomingProperties collections of the received message. Ensure that when the receive context is enabled on the binding, the created channel ensures that '{0}' is present on all received messages.
SFxReceiveContextSettingsPropertyMissing,The contract '{0}' has at least one operation annotated with '{1}', but the binding used for the contract endpoint at address '{2}' does not support required binding property '{3}'. Please ensure that the binding used for the contract supports the ReceiveContext capability.
SfxReflectedContractKeyNotFound2,The contract name '{0}' could not be found in the list of contracts implemented by the service '{1}'.
SfxReflectedContractKeyNotFoundEmpty,In order to add an endpoint to the service '{0}', a non-empty contract name must be specified.
SfxReflectedContractKeyNotFoundIMetadataExchange,The contract name 'IMetadataExchange' could not be found in the list of contracts implemented by the service {0}.  Add a ServiceMetadataBehavior to the configuration file or to the ServiceHost directly to enable support for this contract.
SfxReflectedContractsNotInitialized1,An endpoint for type '{0}' could not be added because the ServiceHost instance was not initialized properly.  In order to add endpoints by Type, the CreateDescription method must be called.  If you are using a class derived from ServiceHost, ensure that the class is properly calling base.CreateDescription.

In this case, the asynchronous OperationContract method '{2}' has one or more attributes of type '{5}'. To fix it, remove the '{5}' attribute or attributes from method '{2}'. Alternatively, changing the name of one of the methods will prevent matching. 
TaskAsyncMatchConsistency_Parameters5,The task-based asynchronous OperationContract method '{0}' in type '{1}' was matched with the asynchronous OperationContract methods '{2}' and '{3}' because they have the same operation name '{4}'. When a task-based asynchronous OperationContract method is matched to a pair of asynchronous OperationContract methods, the two OperationContracts must define the same number and types of parameters. In this case, some of the arguments are different. To fix it, ensure that the OperationContracts define the same number and types of arguments, in the same order. Alternatively, changing the name of one of the methods will prevent matching.
TaskAsyncMatchConsistency_Property6,The task-based asynchronous OperationContract method '{0}' in type '{1}' was matched with the asynchronous OperationContract  methods '{2}' and '{3}' because they have the same operation name '{4}'. When a task-based asynchronous OperationContract method is matched to a pair of asynchronous OperationContract methods, the two OperationContracts must have the same value for the '{5}' property.
